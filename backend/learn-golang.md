# Variables
---
Variables have been ask to be nice and clean, we are able to add shadow variables, but not redeclare in the same statement.

- Always have to be use
- Declare variables
  ```
  var i int = 2
  ```
  or to let the compiler decide for us, as an auto type in C++
  ```
  i := 2
  ```
- Variables in **lower case** will be expose out side outside of the package.
