# Variables
---
Variables have been ask to be nice and clean, we are able to add shadow variables, but not redeclare in the same statement.

- Always have to be use
- Declare variables

  ```
  var i int = 2
  ```
  or to let the compiler decide for us, as an auto type in C++
  
  ```
  i := 2
  ```
  
- Variables in **lower case** will be expose out side outside of the package.

# Primitive
---
Go is very hesitant about implicit data conversion. So, we must be clear of the data type.

## Integer 
- **int8**, **int16**, **int32**, **int64** from different platform which the number represent the bits.  
- **int** is Platform dependent in Golang.  
- **uint** as unsigned integer.
