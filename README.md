## Introduction
For course CEN5035, our group are building a AmazonLive Clone.
We are using Golang in backend programming and ReactJS in frontend programming.
The purpose is to combine live streaming functions to sell products in usersâ€™ online stores. 
We hope to provide users not only a platform to sell their products but also with our features that can help them sell stuff with high efficiency.
